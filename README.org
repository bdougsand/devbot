A simple Python server designed to be used with a Docker Hub webhook.

*Note:* This does not work yet, since Docker Hub does not post the image tag to
the web hook, and I need to find a workaround.

* Requirements
+ Python >3.3
+ dtach
+ Docker Engine and Docker Compose

Additionally, the server must be run as a user in the ~docker~ group. To add the
current user:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo moduser -aG docker $(whoami)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 start.py
#+END_SRC
